## Research
My research interests fall in three macro-areas of computer science and engineering:
- distributed systems
- intelligent and autonomous systems
- algorithms and optimization

Focuses I have interested on are:
- Wireless Sensor Networks
- Edge Computing
- [Edge Intelligence]({{site.baseurl}}/research/edge-ai)
- Federated Learning
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Reinforcement Learning
- Swarm Intelligence
- Genetic Algorithms
